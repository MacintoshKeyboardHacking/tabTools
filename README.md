These are scripts I use to automatically extract and archive TV recordings from Tablo OTA tuners.

A Raspberry Pi 4 extracts content over the network (from a Tablo Quad/HDMI) and via local filesystem (from a USB connected T4G).
Files are automatically named, and smaller or partial recordings are automatically replaced with higher quality versions.
  
As always work is ongoing; for discussion and demonstration see my youtube https://www.youtube.com/@MacintoshKeyboardHacking/streams
